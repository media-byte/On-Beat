## Project Overview

On Beat is a fitness-based health web app that combines the power of 3D modeling, AI pose estimation, and motion tracking to help users learn and compete in yoga and dance routines. With a variety of modes available, users can practice yoga poses, perform exercises like push-ups with a 3D model, and even see live holographic visualizations of their movements.

Our vision is to make fitness interactive, fun, and accurate using cutting-edge technology, allowing users to improve their health from the comfort of their homes.
## Features
#### Yoga Mode
The Yoga Mode helps users practice yoga with real-time feedback on their poses. Currently, we support the Tree Pose (Vrikshasana):

1. Select the Tree Pose from the list of available asanas.
2. Click on Start Yoga to open a new window displaying three reference images of the pose performed by a 3D model.
3. Activate your webcam by clicking Start Yoga again.
4. After 10 seconds, the webcam takes a snapshot of your pose, and the system evaluates the accuracy based on your alignment with the model.
5. You will receive feedback on the accuracy, errors, and suggestions for improvement.

#### Songs and Statistics
In this mode (still in development), users can view:

1. A list of songs or routines designed for dance or yoga workouts.
2. Overall statistics such as total time spent in practice, pose accuracy trends, and improvements over time.

#### 3D Live Render (Push-ups)
A 3D model demonstrates how to perform push-ups in this mode, serving as a guide to help users maintain correct form and posture while performing the exercise. The live render showcases the movement dynamically, allowing users to follow along with the model in real-time.

#### 3D Live Hologram
The 3D Live Hologram mode uses your webcam to create a live holographic capture of your movements. This feature showcases an immersive visualization of your pose, creating a futuristic holographic display while you perform exercises or dance routines.
## Installation
